# Computer Vision Playground

Welcome to my personal playground for experimenting with computer vision using Python and OpenCV. This repository contains various examples and practices that help me learn and explore different techniques in image and video processing.

## Installation

To use the code, you need Python installed on your computer. Then, install the required libraries with:

```
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib Pillow pytesseract
```

Make sure to also install Tesseract OCR from [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and set the path in your code.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/computer-vision-playground.git
cd computer-vision-playground
```

2. Run any of the example scripts. For example, to run the text detection example:

```
python text_detection.py
```

## Examples

- **main.py**: Basic image and video processing, including reading and displaying images.
- **text_detection.py**: Detects and extracts text from images and video frames.
- **color_detection.py**: Identifies specific colors in video streams.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as you wish!
