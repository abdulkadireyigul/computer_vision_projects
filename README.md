# Computer Vision Playground

Welcome to my personal playground for experimenting with computer vision and machine learning techniques. This repository contains various examples and practices that help me learn and explore different methods in image and video processing, text detection, color detection, and more. I will continue to add new projects and experiments over time, utilizing various libraries and frameworks beyond just Python and OpenCV.
